Description = This is a WeiDU mod that restores the 'classic' movies from the original Baldur's Gate and select movies from Baldur's Gate II to Baldur's Gate:  Enhanced Edition (BGEE), Baldur's Gate:  Siege of Dragonspear (SoD), and Baldur's Gate:  Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).  The classic movies have been resized to the same dimensions as the new BGEE movies (1280x720, 852x480, and 512x288) while maintaining their aspect ratios.  It also re-enables the Beregost movie when you first travel to the area and restores a movie to the Elfsong Tavern that was cut from the original game.  This mod was developed for Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition v1.3+ and will be considered a beta version as long as these games are being updated.  As of Version 2.0 there is a new component that restores the vanilla BG1 chapter and dream screens to BGEE/SoD/EET (using the appropriate theme).
